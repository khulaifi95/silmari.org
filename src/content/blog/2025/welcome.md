Hello this is my first post here, which happens to be a short wrap-up of this year's progress in AI.

## Progress

1. GRPO + RLVR
2. Inference scaling
3. Coding agents with tools

## Problems

1. Benchamrk and real-world discrepancy
2. Vibe coding burnout and fatigue
3. Model architecture kind of stuck

## Predictions

1. Efficient deployment of memory system for open-sourced LLMs
2. Unified multi-modal encoding in LLMs
3. First real "Cursor for X" product
