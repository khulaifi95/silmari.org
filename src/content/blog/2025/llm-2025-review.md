I won't talk too much about what happened in the past year, because the whole LLM domain has become so intangible to a normal developer or researcher. I stopped reading publications every morning by June eventually, because the effort to find a true gem has been too high. The signal-to-noise ratio deteriorated to a point where keeping up felt more like a compulsion than genuine learning.

## The Malfunctioning of the Open Source Community

Something shifted in the open source community this year. The collaborative spirit that once drove innovation has been strained by the sheer velocity of change. Projects fork and proliferate faster than they can be meaningfully evaluated. Contributors are stretched thin, maintaining tools that may be obsolete within months. The community that once thrived on shared learning now feels fragmented, each corner racing in different directions without a clear sense of collective progress.

## The Fatigue

The fatigue is real and pervasive. Developers, researchers, and enthusiasts alike are experiencing burnout—not from lack of interest, but from the impossibility of keeping pace. Every week brings new models, new benchmarks, new frameworks. The excitement that once accompanied each breakthrough has given way to exhaustion. We've moved from "Did you see this?" to "Do I need to see this?"

## A Change in Perspective Comes from Altering Your Stance

Perhaps the answer isn't to run faster on the treadmill, but to step off it entirely and observe from a different angle. A change in perspective comes from altering your stance. Instead of trying to absorb everything, we might benefit from selective engagement—focusing on what matters to our specific problems rather than chasing comprehensiveness. The fear of missing out has paralyzed us; maybe it's time to embrace missing out deliberately.

## The Coding Agents Are Ahead of All Other Agents, and All Developers Are Behind

One thing has become clear: coding agents are ahead of all other agents, and all developers are behind. While we were debating best practices and architectural patterns, AI coding assistants evolved to the point where they're not just autocompleting—they're architecting, refactoring, and reasoning about code at scale. The gap between what these agents can do and what most developers have integrated into their workflow is widening, not narrowing.

## Should We Take More Time Considering the Attitude or Sentiment Against Vibe Coding?

This raises an uncomfortable question: should we take more time considering the attitude or sentiment against vibe coding? The instinctive rejection of AI-assisted development as "not real coding" or somehow inferior feels increasingly like denial. There's a cultural resistance to accepting that the nature of software development is fundamentally changing. Maybe the issue isn't the tools, but our attachment to the way things used to be.

## If Everyone Is Behind, Then We Shall Always Take Views with a Grain of Salt from the Big Names

Here's a liberating thought: if everyone is behind, then we shall always take views with a grain of salt from the big names. The experts are learning in real-time just like the rest of us. Their authority comes from past achievements in a landscape that no longer exists in the same form. This isn't to dismiss their insights, but to recognize that in this moment of transition, curiosity and experimentation may matter more than credentials.

## What Is Going to Happen in 2026?

What is going to happen in 2026? Honestly, I don't know. But I suspect the divergence will continue. Some will double down on traditional development practices. Others will fully embrace agent-assisted workflows. And most will exist somewhere in the uncertain middle, trying to figure out what parts of the old way still matter and which parts of the new way are worth adopting.

What I do know is that 2025 taught me that trying to keep up with everything is a fool's errand. 2026 will be about choosing what to pay attention to—and being okay with letting the rest pass by.
